# sqlTest

- the questions told us this query produces the result within 8 seconds.So i assume this is a workable query else i will be asking the ```group by and order by``` part.

Improvements
- table structuring need to be improve which causing 
  - too many joins in one query and 
  - too many `OR` wildcard usage which is ```LIKE %``` 
- the stored data value need to be in a good or standard format so u can avoid using wildcard front and back togather which is really dropping the performance.
